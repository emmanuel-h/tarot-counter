# TarotCounter

An Android app for tracking scores in **French Tarot**, a classic French trick-taking card game.

## What the App Does

TarotCounter guides players through a game round by round:

1. **Setup** — choose 3, 4, or 5 players and optionally enter custom names; duplicate names are detected in real time and the Start button is disabled until all names are unique
2. **Contract selection** — the current taker picks their contract (or skips)
3. **Scoring details** — enter bouts, points scored (0–91), partner (5-player), and any bonuses; a radio button lets you switch between entering the **taker's points** or the **defenders' points** (the app converts automatically using `takerPoints = 91 − defenderPoints`)
4. **Scoreboard & history** — live cumulative scores per player and a log of all rounds, newest first
5. **Score history table** — tap the bar-chart icon (left of the header) to see a round-by-round table of cumulative scores for every player
6. **End Game / Final Score** — tap the checkered-flag icon (right of the header) at any point to see the final results: winner card with total score, full round-by-round table (winner's column highlighted), and a "New Game" button
7. **Auto-save & Resume** — the game state is saved after every round; if the app is closed mid-game, a "Resume Game" card appears on the setup screen the next time it is opened
8. **Past Games** — completed games are saved to the device; the setup screen shows a list of past results

The app automatically rotates the taker each round, determines win/loss, and computes each player's score for the round.

## Game Rules Summary

### Win Condition

The taker wins if they score enough points based on the number of **bouts** (special trump cards) captured:

| Bouts captured | Points needed to win |
|:-:|:-:|
| 0 | 56 |
| 1 | 51 |
| 2 | 41 |
| 3 | 36 |

### Contracts (weakest → strongest)

| Contract | Multiplier |
|---|:---:|
| Prise | ×1 |
| Garde | ×2 |
| Garde Sans | ×4 |
| Garde Contre | ×6 |

### Round Score

```
roundScore = (25 + |scoredPoints − requiredPoints(bouts)|) × multiplier
```

Scores are zero-sum. The taker receives `±(n−1) × roundScore` for 3/4-player games, `±2 × roundScore` in 5-player games (partner gets `±1 × roundScore`); each defender receives `∓roundScore`.

### Bonuses Tracked per Round

Player-assigned bonuses are entered via a compact grid with one checkbox per player. Ticking a checkbox assigns that bonus; ticking it again clears it.

- **Petit au bout** — player who captured the 1 of trump on the last trick
- **Poignée / Double poignée / Triple poignée** — trump distribution bonuses (10 / 13 / 15 trumps shown)
- **Chelem** — grand slam outcome selected from a dropdown (announced+won, announced+lost, unannounced+won, or none), with an additional player selector to record who called it. When an announced chelem is selected and a player is chosen, the app reminds the table that this player leads the first trick.

## Architecture

Single-module Jetpack Compose app — all source lives in `:app` under `fr.mandarine.tarotcounter`.

```
app/src/main/java/fr/mandarine/tarotcounter/
├── MainActivity.kt        # Entry point, top-level navigation state, ViewModel wiring
├── Navigation.kt          # Screen enum (SETUP / GAME)
├── GameModels.kt          # Data models & pure game logic (no Android deps)
├── SavedGame.kt           # Serializable snapshot of a completed game
├── GameStorage.kt         # DataStore read/write + JSON serialization
├── GameViewModel.kt       # Exposes past games as StateFlow, fires save coroutines
├── LandingScreen.kt       # Player setup UI + Past Games list
├── GameScreen.kt          # Round management, taker rotation, history, End Game button
├── RoundDetailsForm.kt    # Scoring details form
├── ScoreHistoryScreen.kt  # Round-by-round cumulative score table
├── FinalScoreScreen.kt    # End-of-game results: winner card + full score table
└── ui/theme/              # Material 3 theme, colors, typography
```

**Key design choice**: `GameModels.kt` contains only pure Kotlin with no Android or Compose imports, making it fully unit-testable on the JVM.

**Persistence**: completed games are saved to **DataStore** as JSON (via `kotlinx.serialization`). A `GameViewModel` holds the `StateFlow<List<SavedGame>>` that the setup screen observes.
